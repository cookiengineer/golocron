## Hello ~Holocron~ Golocron

### The Dark Side of Markdown

Markdown, much like the dark side, is *simple*, yet **powerful**. It can be used to shape
documents and control the `flow of content`. Below are the key features you should
understand first in order to harness its power.

### Basic Formatting

- Use *italics* to signify weakness.
- Use **Bold** to emphasize strength.
- Use ~strikethrough~ to revoke an order.
- Use abbreviations like [MSE-6]{Repair Droids} and [BB-8]{Astromech Droids} to describe them in thorough detail.
- Use links to link to [other websites](https://cookie.engineer/index.html) or to link to [other articles](./another-article.md).

### Advanced Formatting

<figure class="orders">
You can harness the **power** of *embedded* HTML elements.

Embedded language syntax highlighting also works:

```javascript
let ThePower = 1337;
call("the dark side");
harness(ThePower);
```
